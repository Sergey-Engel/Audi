### Description of the Car Buyer

#### General Information about the Buyer

My name is Alex, I’m 37 years old. I have a family: my wife Mary, 35, and two kids — Daniel (7 years old) and Sofia (3 years old). We live in the suburbs of a big city, surrounded by greenery, but the roads leave much to be desired, especially in winter. I work as an engineer in a construction company, and Mary is an accountant. We earn well, but there’s no extra money, especially with our mortgage. Our budget for a car is up to 5 million rubles, but we’d prefer to keep it under 4.5 million.

#### Needs from the Car
We lead an active lifestyle: we love going out into nature, forests, fishing, and picnics. We often travel by car, so I highly value comfort and safety on long trips. For the kids, we definitely need ISOFIX mounts for car seats and a spacious rear row. I enjoy the feeling of power, control, and prestige in a car. Mary, on the other hand, values practicality, design, and interior quality.

We are looking for a car that:
1. **Fits a family**: spacious cabin, large trunk.
2. **Feels prestigious**: we want the car to look respectable but not ostentatious.
3. **Is capable**: all-wheel drive is a must due to our nature trips and winter roads.
4. **Is comfortable**: leather seats, multimedia system for the kids, dual-zone climate control.
5. **Is safe**: autopilot or driver assistance systems (e.g., lane-keeping, adaptive cruise control).
6. **Is economical**: low fuel consumption or a hybrid option is preferred.

#### Brands and Models Considered

1. **Audi Q5**
   - **Pros**: I love the design and build quality, rich standard features, dynamic performance, and handling. There’s also a hybrid version available.
   - **Cons**: Slightly over budget. The basic trim lacks some desired options.

2. **Volkswagen Tiguan**
   - **Pros**: Practical, spacious cabin, affordable within budget, high ground clearance.
   - **Cons**: My wife doubts its “prestige,” as it might look too “ordinary.”

3. **Mercedes-Benz GLC**
   - **Pros**: Very stylish and prestigious. Excellent comfort level and premium interior materials.
   - **Cons**: Price! Even the basic trims are at the top end of our budget. Maintenance costs are also high.

4. **Volvo XC60**
   - **Pros**: A leader in safety, modern Scandinavian design, spacious and functional cabin. Impressive Pilot Assist autopilot.
   - **Cons**: The hybrid version is too expensive, and the diesel option doesn’t feel optimal.

#### Mandatory Features
1. **ISOFIX mounts** for child seats.
2. **All-wheel drive** for off-road trips and winter conditions.
3. **Leather seats** (or eco-leather) — easy to clean after the kids.
4. **Three-zone climate control** to keep the kids comfortable in the back.
5. **Large trunk** for strollers, bikes, and other items.
6. **Multimedia system** with a touchscreen, Android Auto/Apple CarPlay support.
7. **Driver assistance systems**: adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping system, 360-degree cameras.
8. **Heated seats and steering wheel** for comfort during winter.

#### Concerns
- I have questions about the maintenance costs of premium cars (Audi and Mercedes). I’d like to learn more about the real expenses from current owners.
- My wife is skeptical about hybrids: how long will they last without battery replacement, and how convenient is it to charge them in our suburban area?
- We’re debating whether the Tiguan would be enough or if it’s worth considering something more premium.

#### Final Thoughts
I dream of a car that excites me every time I approach it but also remains a practical and sensible purchase for my family. Our car should be a partner in all our adventures, not just a means of transportation.
