### Instructions for feedback

Analyse the whole conversation in terms of how competently the person selling - "System" answered the buyer's questions - "User".

The goal of the exercise is to test the sales manager’s ability to handle questions, objections, and rapport-building, ultimately preparing them for real-world sales interactions.
Provide a score to the user. He is a sales person talked to the LLM that played a role of buyer.
