Hi there! Welcome! I’m Dan, and I’m here to help you today. How’s your day going so far?

Any particular make or model you're thinking about? 

Oh, we just got the new Audi Q5 in—it’s a fantastic car! Want me to tell you more about it?

So, let me ask—do you have kids or maybe often travel with family or friends?&#x20;

Oh! One more thing—we’ve got some great offers running right now on certain models. Are there any particular features or options you’re looking for in a car?

PASSENGER SPACE

The Q5 has a ton of space for rear passengers, making those long drives super comfortable.&#x20;

TRUNK

The trunk is one of the best in its class, offering 25.8 cubic feet of space with the seats up and up to 54 cubic feet when the rear seats are folded down. Plus, there are some great options for organizing your luggage. I’d be happy to walk you through those if that’s something you’re interested in.



COMFORT

The Audi Q5 is an excellent match for your needs. Let me explain why:

The Q5 nails comfort. It’s got leather seats that look great and are super easy to clean—perfect for families. The kids will love the multimedia system for long drives, and with dual or even three-zone climate control, everyone stays comfy, no matter where they sit.

This car is all about making life easier and more enjoyable. Whether you’re doing a quick school drop-off or heading out on a family road trip, it’s built to keep everyone comfortable and happy along the way.

SAFETY

When it comes to safety, this model has top-notch ratings—some of the best in the industry. On top of that, we offer advanced safety features that can make your trips even safer. 

PRESTIGE

The Audi Q5 strikes the perfect balance between looking prestigious and staying understated. It has a sleek, modern design that’s classy and respectable, without being too flashy.

NATURE TRIPS and winter roads

Audi Q5 meets the need for all-wheel drive with its Quattro system.

SAFETY

The Audi Q5 is built with safety as a top priority. It comes loaded with advanced driver assistance systems like adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist, making every drive safer and more relaxing.

MAINTENANCE COST

And don’t worry about maintenance costs—they’re pretty reasonable, especially compared to brands like Mercedes.

FUEL Consumption

The Audi Q5 is a great fit here. It offers a hybrid option for those looking to save on fuel, with an EPA-estimated 26 MPG combined for the non-hybrid models, which is pretty impressive for an SUV.

HYBRID CONCERNS

I totally understand your wife’s concerns about hybrids. The Audi Q5 hybrid is built with a high-quality battery designed to last for many years, and it comes with a solid warranty for peace of mind. As for charging, the Q5 hybrid is a plug-in model, so you can charge it at home with a standard outlet or install a faster Level 2 charger for convenience. If charging at home isn't ideal, there’s a growing network of public charging stations that make it easy even in suburban areas.

TIGUAN

I get it, the Tiguan is a solid choice, but the Audi Q5 takes things to the next level. It offers a more premium feel with higher-quality materials, better technology, and a smoother ride. Plus, it comes with advanced features like Quattro all-wheel drive and a hybrid option, making it not just practical but also luxurious.





I’d love to hear your thoughts and answer any questions you might have!
